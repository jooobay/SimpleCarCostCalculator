# Thanks to the author
I used https://github.com/martijnboland/LeanAspNetCore-React.git from Martijn Boland to help me starting this project


# SimpleCarCostCalculator
A 'lean' ASP.NET 6.0 app that uses React with JSX for some of the client functionality. A really simple InMemory databse is used to
show posibilities with Entity Framework

## Prerequisites
.NET 6.0 (or higher) SDK
Node.js 12.0.0 or higher

## Getting started
```
git clone https://github.com/jooobay/SimpleCarCostCalculator.git
cd SimpleCarCostCalculator
dotnet run
```
Browse to https://localhost:5001 to see the working app. 

At the first run, it takes a little while before all dependencies are resolved. Just have a little patience. After the first run, things are much faster.
